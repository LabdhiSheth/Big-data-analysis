K means
Having learned about various supervised learning algorithms let us now jump to some of the unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Lets us start with k means clustering. 
A small revision on unsupervised learning: unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labeled, outcomes.

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
 Well, the idea behind K-means is simple we group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To perform the algorithms find a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.

The terminology, cluster here refers to a collection of data points grouped together because of certain similarities. Clustering helps us understand our data in a unique way that is by grouping things together into clusters. In clustering, we do not have a target to predict. We look at the data and then try to club similar observations and form different groups. Hence it is an unsupervised learning problem.
